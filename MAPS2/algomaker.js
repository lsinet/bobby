The recent explosion of affordable research tools and abundant data has brought bioscience within reach of kids, amateur scientists, and pre-startup garage labs alike. BioCurious fills an important gap by offering education, outreach, and community building for science novices and citizen scientists, as well as entrepreneurship incubation, mentoring and angel investment for budding biotech entrepreneurs. Starting from meetups in a garage lab, we have grown into the largest DIYbio group in the world and have recently opened a community-run biolab in Sunnyvale, supported by online fundraising, membership fees, class fees, and a number of commercial sponsors.

    "Description":"i3 Detroit is a collaborative environment for people to explore the balance between technology, art and culture. We feel the best way to create this environment is to bring together like-minded people who share a common passion for technology, art and culture. The community is run by its members through voting. All founding members have worked together to create a set of by-laws that all members and supporters follow. The goal is to provide a safe and fun community environment. Our goal is to stay a community resource through continuous hosting of various classes and events. We have created an environment that promotes learning in a fun non-traditional format. i3 Detroit is continually working with other hackerspaces and community organizations to work on projects, events and educational opportunities. What does i3 stand for: Imagine, Innovate & Inspire",

    "Description":"At just under a century old, the F.H. Steinbart Co. of Portland, OR is the oldest homebrew supply store in the United States. F.H. Steinbart Co. was founded in 1918 by Frank H. Steinbart. Near the end of the prohibition, Steinbart passed away. It was at this time that the store was purchased by two of his employees, Angelo Curtello and Joseph DeBenedetti who later passed the business on to his son John DeBenedetti. Home brewing has always been a hobby that is centered on sharing and community. Everyone loves beer and since beer is easy and inexpensive to make, home brewing has served to remove social and economical boundaries. To this day F.H. Steinbart Co. is a hub for all kinds of brewers, not just for home brewers, but professionals and publicans alike. We are looking forward to serving the homebrew community as best we can for as long as we can. It is our passion to seethat spark in the eye of a new brewer tasting his or her first batch of delicious home brewed beer! Cheers!",

The stuff that doesn’t make the grade is not banished to landfills to leach toxics into the water table. Nor is it sent to developing nations to be disassembled by small children. We do our very best to make sure that all electronic materials we don’t reuse are responsibly recycled within North America.

Since it is a non-profit museum, older games from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s are the prevelant, as this was the 'heyday' of pinball. There are no 'ticket spitters' here (aka kiddie casinos or redemption). It's all pure pinball (and a few arcade novelty games) from the past.

Building robots for a competition is fun, but you want to do something more meaningful. Whenever you try to work on a tech project, you never finsh. Perhaps something doesn't work, so you get frustrated and play videogames for the next week. Or you get distracted, because there's a homework assignment tomorrow and a test next week. We were frustrated by the same things. That's why we started StudentRND. In 2009, Edward Jiang convinced his friends to hang out at his house and build cool technology projects instead of getting a summer job. And that's grown into StudentRND today, a community of students who help each other do amazing things.",

It is a shared space where members can have a place to be creative and work on their projects in an environment that is both inspiring and supportive of both new and old technologies. We had our first meeting on the 21st of January 2009 with a group of 17 people, some who had never met before, came together to form a group with the intention of setting up a hackerspace in Dublin. The meeting was great and everyone was full of enthusiasm. In less then 3 months we had membership coming in from over 20 members and a roof over our head. The space is fully funded by its members and gives members 24/7 access to work on a project or just a place to hang out. For more photos check out our gallery.",

    "Description":"At Inventables we understand it is harder for these smaller teams to source materials in smaller sizes and quantities for their new micro-production runs. To solve this problem, we are building a “Designers Hardware Store” that sells materials in small shapes and sizes for desktop fabrication. We believe this will streamline the process of local manufacturing. Through our website inventables.com we sell equipment and supplies in small quantities for purchase with a credit card. Our selection ranges from over 100 colors of acrylic sheets to 3D printers. Custom manufacturers, product designers, researchers, artists, and inventors purchase from our selection of about 30,000 products.",

Inoltre Urban FabLab si propone di sviluppare progetti che andranno dalla scala territoriale a quella architettonica fino a prodotti di design combinando insieme innovazione tecnologica, sostenibilità ambientale e creatività. Le attività di ricerca / sviluppo e di formazione / divulgazione saranno particolarmente sensibili ai temi dell’ecologia urbana, della co-produzione e dell’artigianato avanzato mettendo in relazione comunità scientifica, istituzioni locali e la collettività.",

Il Laboratorio, con la direzione scientifica di Paolo Cascone, si avvale di un approccio interdisciplinare per lo sviluppo di idee e la realizzazione di prototipi integrando processi progettuali avanzati (ecological design e progettazione parametrica) con la cultura dell’auto-produzione (auto-costruzione e fabbricazione digitale). Inoltre Urban FabLab si propone di sviluppare progetti che andranno dalla scala territoriale a quella architettonica fino a prodotti di design combinando insieme innovazione tecnologica, sostenibilità ambientale e creatività. Le attività di ricerca / sviluppo e di formazione / divulgazione saranno particolarmente sensibili ai temi dell’ecologia urbana, della co-produzione e dell’artigianato avanzato mettendo in relazione comunità scientifica, istituzioni locali e la collettività.",
