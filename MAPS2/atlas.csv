Il Laboratorio, con la direzione scientifica di Paolo Cascone, si avvale di un approccio interdisciplinare per lo sviluppo di idee e la realizzazione di prototipi integrando processi progettuali avanzati (ecological design e progettazione parametrica) con la cultura dell’auto-produzione (auto-costruzione e fabbricazione digitale). Inoltre Urban FabLab si propone di sviluppare progetti che andranno dalla scala territoriale a quella architettonica fino a prodotti di design combinando insieme innovazione tecnologica, sostenibilità ambientale e creatività. Le attività di ricerca / sviluppo e di formazione / divulgazione saranno particolarmente sensibili ai temi dell’ecologia urbana, della co-produzione e dell’artigianato avanzato mettendo in relazione comunità scientifica, istituzioni locali e la collettività."",Makerspace,""40.8517746,14.2681244""";;;;;
